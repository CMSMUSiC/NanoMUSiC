# tools3a
This repository contains tools and libraries for the TAPAS framework.

## Documentation
A brief manual for each interactive tool/script should be printed when calling the script with the `--help` parameter.

Additionally, all tools should be documented in [this project's Gitlab Wiki](https://gitlab.cern.ch/aachen-3a/tools/wikis/home).
[Some pages](https://gitlab.cern.ch/aachen-3a/tools/wikis/pages) have already been written.

Finally, a documentation overview can be found at the [TAPAS Documentation Server](https://dfs.cern.ch/dfs/websites/c/cms-project-aachen3a-doc/).

Also, some of the TAPAS decisions have been documented during our jamborees.
[Check indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/2112/search?search-phrase=TAPAS&search-field=&search-start_date=&search-end_date=) for recent talks on this subject.

## Contributing
Some rules for people who like to contribute:
 - Please make sure to push only sufficiently documented code to this repository!
   This means at least meaningful docstring and full doxygen markup as best practice.
