MUSiC - Model Unspecific Search in CMS 
ðŸ“¶ Run 2 - Ultra Legacy, using NanoAOD ðŸ“¶

## About 

This repository stands on the shoulders of the work done by many brilliant students and scientists of III. Physikalisches Institut A und B (RWTH Aachen University), that along many years touched this code. Their contributions are mainly hosted in the legacy repositories below:

- https://gitlab.cern.ch/aachen-3a/tapas
- https://gitlab.cern.ch/aachen-3a/pxlanalyzer
- https://gitlab.cern.ch/aachen-3a/PxlSkimmer
- https://gitlab.cern.ch/MUSiC/MUSiC-EventClassFactory
- https://gitlab.cern.ch/MUSiC/MUSiC-Configs
- https://gitlab.cern.ch/MUSiC/MUSiC-Utils
- https://gitlab.cern.ch/MUSiC/MUSiC-RoIScanner
- https://gitlab.cern.ch/aachen-3a/lstar-analyzer/-/tree/ghosh_202107_updates

This repo is just a convolution of the algorithms and tools mentioned above, including:
- modernized C++ and Python code;
- GPU implementations of computing demanding procedures;
- simpler workflows and environment setups;
- adaptations to the NanoAOD format, supported by the CMS experiment.
