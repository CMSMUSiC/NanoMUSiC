/**
 By inheritance from pxl::ObjectManager,
 this class is capable of holding the complete information of one
 multicollision event with decay trees, spatial vertex information,
 four-momenta as well as additional event-related reconstruction data
 in the user records. Physics objects (i.e. instances of the classes pxl::Particle,
 pxl::Vertex or pxl::Collision) as well as other arbitrary pxl::Relative
 derivatives can be aggregated and managed.
 The name 'event view'  arises from the fact that it is
 intended to represent a distinct view of an event (e.g. connecting
 particles to the decay tree according to one out of a
 number of hypotheses, applying different jet energy corrections, etc.).
 To facilitate the development of numerous
 parallel or subsequent event views, as needed for hypothesis evolution,
 for instance, this class features a copy constructor
 which provides a deep copy of the event container with all data members,
 hep objects, and their (redirected) relations.
 This way, PXL provides a flexible generalized event container
 meeting the needs of HEP analyses in channels with ambiguous
 event topologies.
