# Trigger.IgnoreL1 = <1 or 0>
#                    If true (1), ignore present L1 Trigger information
#                    completely.
# Trigger.IgnoreHL = <1 or 0>
#                    If true (1), ignore present HLT information completely.
# Trigger.Prefix = <string>
#                  All HLTs are stored with a prefix (set while skimming).
#                  In most cases this will be 'HLT'.
# Trigger.Groups = <comma separated list of 'Trigger.Groups' to be considered>
#                  Only the 'Trigger.Groups' specified here are considered!
#                  The values here are "arbitrary" but must match the actual
#                  label of the 'Trigger.Groups' specified below, e.g. when
#                  specifying 'Trigger.Groups = Muo,Ele', there must be
#                  'Trigger.Muo' and 'Trigger.Ele' defined somewhere.
#
# A 'Trigger.<group>' consists of the following information
# (<group> is e.g. Muo or Ele etc.):
#
#  - .Name = <string to identify the trigger group>
#            At this moment only used for debugging.
#  - .Triggers = <comma separated list of HLTs to be considered in this group>
#                E.g. all SingleMu triggers to be considered.
#  - .Cuts.<object> = <list of pt thresholds for objects>
#                     This also defines the event topology to be considered.
#                     E.g. if you specify 'Cuts.Mu = 25,20', only events with
#                     one muon with pt > 25 GeV AND one muon with pt > 20 GeV
#                     will be considered!
#                     You can specify Cuts for more than one object, then only
#                     events passing both topological requirements are
#                     considered.
#                     Legal <object> labels are: Muo, Ele, Tau, Gam, Jet, MET.
#  - .Require = <1 or 0>
#               If true (1), any of the triggers specified in .Triggers must
#               have fired AND all topological requirements must be fulfilled,
#               otherwise the event is not considered.
#  - .Reject = <1 or 0>
#              If true (1), if any of the triggers specified in .Triggers has
#              fired AND all topological requirements are fulfilled, the event
#              is rejected (vetoed).
