The configs for the EventClassFactory are moved to this config repo and should be edited here.

This repository serves also as a log for new submissions. For every submission a new commit is pushed with the used set of configs, the sample lists, scales.txt and merge configs. If a submission is experimental, create a new branch or use an existent experimental branch, which describes the purpose of the commit.
