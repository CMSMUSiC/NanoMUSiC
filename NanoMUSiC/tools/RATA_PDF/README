#  How to get everything running:

-no need to instll LHAPDF!!
--------------old--------------
#        - Start by installing LHAPDF6.0.5 with the 'install.sh' script
#                + it will also download all standard PDFsets (modify if neccessary)
#                + if LHAPDF and PDFsets already exist, modify 'Makefile' and 'pdf.cfg' to use it
#        - Set the library paths:
#                + 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD/local/lib/'
#                + 'export LHAPDF_BASE=$PWD/local/'
--------------old--------------
- source set_env.sh
- Compile 'hist_maker.cpp' with the Makefile
	+ 'make'
- Modify the *.cfg files for your needs:
	+ 'pdf.cfg':
		* Set the path information for the PDF sets
		* Set the name of the Tree and Branches with all PDF information from your analysis
		* List of all PDF sets used for the uncertainty evaluation
		* Combination of PDFs
		* Example values for the standard PDF systematic uncertainty evaluation with CT, MSTW and NNPDF
	+ 'Bag.cfg'
		* Config file for the background samples used in your analysis
		* General information to the samples:
			~ Path to all files
			~ Lumi used for scaling
			~ Name of the final histogram
			~ Binning that should be used
			~ Outfile
		* Different MC sets
			~ important information for each sample: The PDF set used for the production of this sample
	+ 'Sig.cfg'
		* Same as 'Bag.cfg' just for your signal samples
	+ 'xs.cfg'
		* Cross section information for each MC sample

# Now everything is set up and you can start your PDF calculations

- Run the PDF calculation:
	+ './RATA_PDF.py'
		* chose option '-s' for signal samples
			~ The PDF uncertainties will be calculated for each sample and will be appended to the signal file
		* chose option '-b' for background samples
			~ The PDF uncertainties will be calculated for all samples weighted and merged with their cross section
